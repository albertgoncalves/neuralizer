# Neuralizer

Simple point-and-click neural network based on [dennybritz/nn-from-scratch](https://github.com/dennybritz/nn-from-scratch/blob/master/nn_from_scratch.py), implemented in **JavaScript** and untested outside of **Google Chrome**. Hiding somewhere is a **Python** version. Lots of `numpy` over there.
